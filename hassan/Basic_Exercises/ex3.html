   <div><p>Same bed but it feels just a little bit <span>bigger now</span></p>
<p>Our song on the radio but it <span>don't sound the same</span></p>
<p>our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down</p>
<p>'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name</p> </div>
<br>

<div><p>all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo</p>
<p>Mm, too young, too dumb to realize</p>
<p>That I should have bought you flowers</p>
<p>And held your hand</p>
<p>Should have gave you <span>all my hours</span></p>
<p>When I had the chance</p>
<p>Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance</p></div>
